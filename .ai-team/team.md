### Capabilities

**🟢 Good fit — auto-route when enabled:**
- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Test coverage (adding missing tests, fixing flaky tests)
- Lint/format fixes and code style cleanup
- Dependency updates and version bumps
- Small isolated features with clear specs
- Boilerplate/scaffolding generation
- Documentation fixes and README updates

**🟡 Needs review — route to @copilot but flag for squad member PR review:**
- Medium features with clear specs and acceptance criteria
- Refactoring with existing test coverage
- CLI command additions following established patterns
- Internal package additions following established patterns

**🔴 Not suitable — route to squad member instead:**
- Architecture decisions and system design
- Multi-system integration requiring coordination
- Ambiguous requirements needing clarification
- Security-critical changes (auth, encryption, access control)
- Performance-critical paths requiring benchmarking
- Changes requiring cross-team discussion

## Key Decisions

See `.ai-team/decisions.md` for team decisions. Notable:

- **Model selection (2026-02-18):** Coding in Claude Opus 4.6 (premium), reviews in GPT-5.3-Codex, design in Gemini Pro 3
- **Web UI styling (2026-02-18):** Dashboard colors close to DevEx Token Efficiency Benchmarks, no fancy gradients
